**Project:** Attendance Management Project — Part 1  
**Student:** Your Full Name  
**Squad:** SXX

## Description
Part 1: Project setup and a small Java app demonstrating encapsulation using a `Student` class and a `Main` program.

## How to compile & run
From project root:
```bash
javac src/com/school/Student.java src/com/school/Main.java
java -cp src com.school.Main


## Part-02 — Core Domain Modelling

This part introduces `Student` and `Course` domain classes and demonstrates managing them using arrays.

### How to compile & run
```bash
javac src/com/school/*.java
java -cp src com.school.Main


## Part-03 — Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation

This part implements constructors for `Student` and `Course` and adds automatic unique ID generation using static counters.

### What changed
- `Student` now auto-generates integer IDs (studentId) using `nextStudentIdCounter` and constructors `Student(String name)` and `Student(String name, int age, double attendancePercent)`.
- `Course` now auto-generates integer IDs (courseId) starting at 101 using `nextCourseIdCounter` and constructors `Course(String courseName)` and `Course(String courseName, String instructor, int maxStudents)`.
- `Course` `toString()` prints the id prefixed with `C` (e.g., `C101`).

### How to compile & run
From project root:
```bash
javac src/com/school/*.java
java -cp src com.school.Main


## Part-04 — Data Encapsulation & Attendance Recording Validation

This part applies encapsulation to `Student` and `Course` (private fields + public getters)
and adds `AttendanceRecord` to store attendance with validation.

- `AttendanceRecord(int studentId, int courseId, String status)` validates `status`.
  - Accepts "Present" or "Absent" (case-insensitive).
  - Any other value becomes "Invalid" and prints a warning.

How to compile & run:
```bash
javac src/com/school/*.java
java -cp src com.school.Main


## Part-05 — Establishing Students, Teaching & Non-Teaching Staff hierarchy

- Added `Person.java` (base class) with `id`, `name`, and a universal auto-ID generator.
- Implemented `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Staff` classes that extend `Person`.
- Each subclass overrides `displayDetails()` to print role-specific information.
- `Main.java` demonstrates creation and display of Student, Teacher, and Staff objects and uses `student.getId()` in `AttendanceRecord`.

How to compile & run:
```bash
javac src/com/school/*.java
java -cp src com.school.Main


### Files generated by Part-06
- `students.txt` (CSV: id,name,gradeLevel)
- `courses.txt` (CSV: courseId,courseName)
- `attendance_log.txt` (CSV: studentId,courseId,status)

How to run:
1. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java`
2. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`
3. Verify files `students.txt`, `courses.txt`, `attendance_log.txt` appear in the project root.


## Part 7: Polymorphic Behaviour in Attendance and Displaying Reports
- Modified `AttendanceRecord` to hold `Student` and `Course` objects instead of just their IDs, enhancing its object-oriented nature and how records are displayed. The `toDataString()` method still uses IDs for simpler file storage.
- Created a `displaySchoolDirectory(List<Person> people)` method in `Main.java` to demonstrate polymorphism. This method iterates through a list of `Person` objects (containing `Student`, `Teacher`, `Staff` instances) and calls `person.displayDetails()`. The correct overridden method for each specific object type is executed at runtime.
- Populated a `List<Person>` in `main` and used it with `displaySchoolDirectory`.
- Updated `Main.java` to use `instanceof` and casting when preparing the list of students for saving, as `Person` itself does not implement `Storable`.
- Discussed how polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code by treating different object types uniformly through a common interface or base class reference.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java`
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`


## Part 8: Overloaded Commands: Multiple Ways to Mark and Query Attendance
- Created an `AttendanceService.java` class to encapsulate attendance logic and manage the list of `AttendanceRecord` objects.
- Implemented overloaded `markAttendance` methods in `AttendanceService`:
    - `markAttendance(Student student, Course course, String status)`
    - `markAttendance(int studentId, int courseId, String status, List<Student> allStudents, List<Course> allCourses)` (performs lookups)
- Implemented overloaded `displayAttendanceLog` methods in `AttendanceService`:
    - `displayAttendanceLog()` (shows all records)
    - `displayAttendanceLog(Student student)` (filters by student)
    - `displayAttendanceLog(Course course)` (filters by course)
- Utilized Java Streams for filtering records in the specific display methods.
- `AttendanceService` now uses `FileStorageService` to save its `attendanceLog`.
- Demonstrated the use of these overloaded methods in `Main.java`, showing how different method signatures allow for flexible ways to call the same conceptual operation.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java`
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`
4. Check `attendance_log.txt` for saved records.
